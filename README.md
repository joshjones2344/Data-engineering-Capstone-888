#  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Data Engineering Capstone Project
## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging data engineering techniques to create a relational database using SQLite3 in Python. The dataset encompasses Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators, blending various sources into a comprehensive database for insightful analysis.

## Key Features
> * SQLite3 Database: Utilize the power of SQLite3 for efficient and scalable relational data storage.
> * Pandas and NumPy: Process and manipulate data effectively with Pandas and NumPy libraries.
> *  GeoPandas and Shapely: Incorporate spatial data and geometries for geospatial analysis.
> * Matplotlib and Plotly Express: Create informative visualizations to derive meaningful insights.
## Project Structure
> * data/: Contains the raw data files used in the project.
> * scripts/: Python scripts for data processing, database creation, and analysis.
> * notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
> * docs/: Documentation files, including this README.
## Setup and Usage
1. Install the required dependencies:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Execute the Python scripts in the scripts/ folder to run the data engineering pipeline.
## Visualizations
Explore the notebooks/ folder for Jupyter notebooks containing visualizations and analyses.
